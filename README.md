# FMPSD
A small collection of classes for reading and writing PSD images from your friends at Flying Meat (and used in Acorn).

# Status
The files are a bit wonky right now from being ripped out of Acorn, there's debugging stuff all over the place, and there's no good test harness.

# What works
Reading and writing of 8 bit bitmap layers.  Text and layer styles are not currently supported (but we'll happily take patches).
